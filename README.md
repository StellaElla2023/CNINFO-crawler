# CNINFO Web Crawler
巨潮资讯网 爬虫

This project is designed for crawling various types of document in [CNINFO(巨潮资讯网)](http://www.cninfo.com.cn/new/index).This website contains all the announcements, reports and published documents required by Exchanges.

The default setup allows users to download annual reports. However, you can satisfy your needs by changing specific parameters in the code. 
- For other target files: `searchkey`
- For other target time period: `seDate`
- For specific companies: `stock`

If you want to learn about how to build up such a crawler, I recorded a series of vedio to give a step-by-step illustration. Hence, it is friendly to green hands. Feel free to have a try!
The vedios are in Chinese. [Click here to jump.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Nq4y1q7vf/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)
